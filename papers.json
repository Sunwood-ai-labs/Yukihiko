    "title": "Harvesting Textual and Structured Data from the HAL Publication Repository",
    "summary": "HAL (Hyper Articles en Ligne) is the French national publication repository, used by most higher education and research organizations for their open science policy. As a digital library, it is a rich repository of scholarly documents, but its potential for advanced research has been underutilized. We present HALvest, a unique dataset that bridges the gap between citation networks and the full text of papers submitted on HAL. We craft our dataset by filtering HAL for scholarly publications, resulting in approximately 700,000 documents, spanning 34 languages across 13 identified domains, suitable for language model training, and yielding approximately 16.5 billion tokens (with 8 billion in French and 7 billion in English, the most represented languages). We transform the metadata of each paper into a citation network, producing a directed heterogeneous graph. This graph includes uniquely identified authors on HAL, as well as all open submitted papers, and their citations. We provide a baseline for authorship attribution using the dataset, implement a range of state-of-the-art models in graph representation learning for link prediction, and discuss the usefulness of our generated knowledge graph structure.",

    "title": "Adapting Safe-for-Work Classifier for Malaysian Language Text: Enhancing Alignment in LLM-Ops Framework",
    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into operational workflows (LLM-Ops), there is a pressing need for effective guardrails to ensure safe and aligned interactions, including the ability to detect potentially unsafe or inappropriate content across languages. However, existing safe-for-work classifiers are primarily focused on English text. To address this gap for the Malaysian language, we present a novel safe-for-work text classifier tailored specifically for Malaysian language content. By curating and annotating a first-of-its-kind dataset of Malaysian text spanning multiple content categories, we trained a classification model capable of identifying potentially unsafe material using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. This work represents an important step in enabling safer interactions and content filtering to mitigate potential risks and ensure responsible deployment of LLMs. To maximize accessibility and promote further research towards enhancing alignment in LLM-Ops for the Malaysian context, the model is publicly released at https://huggingface.co/malaysia-ai/malaysian-sfw-classifier.",

Meltemi 7B has 7 billion parameters and is trained on a 40 billion token Greek corpus. For the development of Meltemi 7B, we adapt Mistral, by continuous pretraining on the Greek Corpus. Meltemi 7B contains up-to-date information up to September 2023. Furthermore, we have translated and curated a Greek instruction corpus, which has been used for the instruction-tuning of a chat model, named Meltemi 7B Instruct. Special care has been given to the alignment and the removal of toxic content for the Meltemi 7B Instruct. The developed models are evaluated on a broad set of collected evaluation corpora, and examples of prompts and responses are presented.

    "title": "Diffusion Augmented Agents: A Framework for Efficient Exploration and Transfer Learning",
    "summary": "We introduce Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving manipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.

    "title": "JaColBERTv2.5: Optimising Multi-Vector Retrievers to Create State-of-the-Art Japanese Retrievers with Constrained Resources",
    "summary": "Neural Information Retrieval has advanced rapidly in high-resource languages, but progress in lower-resource ones such as Japanese has been hindered by data scarcity, among other challenges. Consequently, multilingual models have dominated Japanese retrieval, despite their computational inefficiencies and inability to capture linguistic nuances. While recent multi-vector monolingual models like JaColBERT have narrowed this gap, they still lag behind multilingual methods in large-scale evaluations. This work addresses the suboptimal training methods of multi-vector retrievers in lower-resource settings, focusing on Japanese. We systematically evaluate and improve key aspects of the inference and training settings of JaColBERT, and more broadly, multi-vector models. We further enhance performance through a novel checkpoint merging step, showcasing it to be an effective way of combining the benefits of fine-tuning with the generalization capabilities of the original checkpoint. Building on our analysis, we introduce a novel training recipe, resulting in the JaColBERTv2.5 model. JaColBERTv2.5, with only 110 million parameters and trained in under 15 hours on 4 A100 GPUs, significantly outperforms all existing methods across all common benchmarks, reaching an average score of 0.754, significantly above the previous best of 0.720. To support future research, we make our final models, intermediate checkpoints and all data used publicly available.",

    "title": "ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an innovative approach for image matting that redefines the traditional regression-based task as a generative modeling challenge. Our method harnesses the capabilities of latent diffusion models, enriched with extensive pre-trained knowledge, to regularize the matting process. We present novel architectural innovations that empower our model to produce mattes with superior resolution and detail. The proposed method is versatile and can perform both guidance-free and guidance-based image matting, accommodating a variety of additional cues. Our comprehensive evaluation across three benchmark datasets demonstrates the superior performance of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results not only reflect our method's robust effectiveness but also highlight its ability to generate visually compelling mattes that approach photorealistic quality.

    "title": "Futga: Towards Fine-grained Music Understanding through Temporally-enhanced Generative Augmentation",
    "summary": "Existing music captioning methods are limited to generating concise global descriptions of short music clips, which fail to capture fine-grained musical characteristics and time-aware musical changes. To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach.
